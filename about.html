                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Ria Bahadur has devoted her life to the cause of human rights with an unwavering dedication. At 12, she joined non-profits with the goal of ending sex trafficking. By 15, she was confronting societal stigma as an advocate and survivor, undeterred by the challenges ahead.</p>
                <p>At 16, Ria became the youngest person to secure an ESSER educational grant, using the funds to author a curriculum titled “Sexual Violence and Sex Trafficking in the 21st Century.” At 17, she became the youngest person to draft, champion, and pass a state bill mandating comprehensive sex trafficking education in Washington state’s public, private, and tribal schools.</p>
                <p>Now at 19, Ria continues her work on SB 5355, striving to see it pass in every U.S. state and country worldwide. With the ultimate aim to enact customary international law by the time she’s 22, she seeks support from people worldwide to bring this vision to life.</p>

                <h3>Mission of SB 5355</h3>
                <p>The mission of SB 5355 is to eradicate sex trafficking through awareness, education, and legal action. Ria’s vision for the bill is not only to protect vulnerable populations but to dismantle systemic structures enabling trafficking worldwide.</p>
                <p>Through SB 5355, Ria hopes to raise global awareness, enforce laws to protect young people, and ultimately foster a future where every child is safe from exploitation. By educating youth and communities on the realities of trafficking, SB 5355 serves as both a preventative measure and a call to action.</p>
                <blockquote>“My journey begins and ends with you. Join me in this mission and make freedom a reality for millions.”</blockquote>
